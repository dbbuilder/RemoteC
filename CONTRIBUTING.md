## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/your-org/remotec/issues)
- If not, create a new issue with:
  - Clear, descriptive title
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - System information (OS, .NET version, etc.)
  - Relevant logs or screenshots

### Suggesting Features

- Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/your-org/remotec/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/your-org/remotec/discussions)
- Create a new discussion or issue with:
  - Clear use case
  - Proposed solution
  - Alternative solutions considered
  - Potential impact on existing features

### Code Contributions

1. **Small Changes**: For typos, documentation updates, or minor bug fixes, feel free to submit a PR directly
2. **Large Changes**: Please discuss in an issue or discussion first to ensure alignment with project goals

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Docker Desktop (for containerized development)
- Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code / Rider
- SQL Server 2019+ (or use Docker)
- Redis (or use Docker)
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Manual Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   dotnet restore
   
   # Run database migrations
   dotnet ef database update -p src/RemoteC.Data -s src/RemoteC.Api
   
   # Run the API
   cd src/RemoteC.Api
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   # All tests
   dotnet test
   
   # Unit tests only
   dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
   
   # With coverage
   dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover
   ```

## Coding Standards

### C# Code Style

- Follow the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) settings
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Add XML documentation to public APIs
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Database

- All database access MUST use stored procedures
- Follow naming convention: `sp_EntityAction` (e.g., `sp_UserCreate`)
- Include proper error handling in stored procedures
- Document complex queries

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Example:
```
feat(auth): add multi-factor authentication support

- Implement TOTP-based 2FA
- Add QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Update user settings UI

Closes #123
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage (target: 80%)
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user scenarios

Example test:
```csharp
[Fact]
[Category("Unit")]
public async Task CreateSession_WithValidRequest_ReturnsNewSession()
{
    // Arrange
    var request = new CreateSessionRequest { /* ... */ };
    
    // Act
    var result = await _service.CreateSessionAsync(request);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.NotNull(result);
    Assert.Equal(SessionStatus.Pending, result.Status);
}
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Submitting**:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run code analysis: `dotnet build /p:AnalysisMode=AllEnabledByDefault`
   - Update documentation if needed
