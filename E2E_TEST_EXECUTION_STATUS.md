# E2E Test Execution Status

## Current Status
The E2E tests have been created and configured but require manual execution in a Windows environment where the browsers can be properly launched.

## Test Setup Completed âœ…
1. **Playwright Framework**: Installed and configured
2. **Test Suites Created**: 6 comprehensive test suites
3. **Port Configuration**: Updated to use port 17002
4. **Auto-start Configuration**: Set up to start API and UI servers

## Test Files Created
- `auth.spec.ts` - Authentication tests (6 tests)
- `sessions.spec.ts` - Session management tests (7 tests)  
- `devices.spec.ts` - Device management tests (8 tests)
- `navigation.spec.ts` - Navigation tests (5 tests)
- `dashboard.spec.ts` - Dashboard tests (8 tests)
- `theme.spec.ts` - Theme switching tests (3 tests)

**Total: 37 E2E tests**

## To Run the Tests

### Windows Environment (Recommended)
```batch
# From project root
scripts\run-e2e-tests.bat
```

### Manual Steps
1. Start the API server:
   ```batch
   scripts\start-server-windows.bat
   ```

2. In another terminal, navigate to the web directory:
   ```batch
   cd src\RemoteC.Web
   ```

3. Run the E2E tests:
   ```batch
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

### Alternative Commands
```batch
# Run with UI (interactive mode)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Expected Test Results

When the tests run successfully, they will:
1. Launch browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. Start the API and UI servers automatically
3. Execute all 37 tests across 6 test suites
4. Generate an HTML report at `playwright-report/index.html`
5. Take screenshots on any failures

## Why Tests Didn't Execute in WSL

The tests require a graphical environment to launch browsers. In the WSL environment without a display server, Playwright cannot launch the browser instances. The tests should be run in:
1. Windows environment with the batch script
2. WSL with X11 forwarding configured
3. CI/CD environment with headless browsers

## Next Steps

1. Run tests in Windows environment using `scripts\run-e2e-tests.bat`
2. Review the HTML report for any failures
3. Add to CI/CD pipeline with headless configuration
4. Consider adding visual regression tests

The test infrastructure is fully set up and ready to execute in an appropriate environment.
