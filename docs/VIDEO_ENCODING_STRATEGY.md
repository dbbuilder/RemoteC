# Video Encoding Strategy for RemoteC

## Overview

This document outlines the video encoding strategy for RemoteC, comparing FFmpeg versus native library approaches and defining our implementation roadmap.

## FFmpeg vs Native Libraries Comparison

### FFmpeg Approach

**Pros:**
- **Single dependency**: One library handles multiple codecs (H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9)
- **Battle-tested**: Used in production by countless applications
- **Feature-rich**: Supports hardware acceleration, filters, muxing/demuxing
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS with same API
- **Active development**: Regular updates and security patches

**Cons:**
- **Large size**: FFmpeg libraries can add 50-100MB to deployment
- **GPL/LGPL licensing**: May require dynamic linking or license compliance
- **Complex API**: Steep learning curve, lots of boilerplate
- **Overkill**: Includes many features RemoteC doesn't need

### Native Libraries Approach

#### OpenH264 (Cisco)
**Pros:**
- **BSD license**: Very permissive
- **Cisco pays MPEG-LA fees**: No H.264 royalties for binary distributions
- **Lightweight**: ~2MB library size
- **Simple API**: Focused solely on H.264

**Cons:**
- **H.264 only**: Need other libraries for H.265, VP8/VP9
- **Limited features**: No hardware acceleration on some platforms

#### x265 (HEVC)
**Pros:**
- **Best H.265 quality**: Reference implementation
- **Good performance**: Optimized assembly code

**Cons:**
- **GPL license**: More restrictive
- **Patent concerns**: HEVC patent pool issues
- **Larger size**: ~10MB library

#### libvpx (VP8/VP9)
**Pros:**
- **BSD license**: Permissive
- **Google backing**: Well-maintained
- **WebRTC compatible**: Important for browser interop

**Cons:**
- **Slower encoding**: Especially VP9
- **Complex API**: Requires careful configuration

## Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Approach

Given RemoteC's requirements for high performance, reasonable deployment size, and enterprise flexibility, we recommend a hybrid approach that evolves across phases:

### Phase 2 (Current Priority)
- **Primary codec**: OpenH264 for H.264 encoding
- **Rationale**: Quick integration, no licensing concerns, small size
- **Target**: <100ms latency, 30fps at 1080p

### Phase 3 (Future Enhancement)
- **Add FFmpeg**: As optional feature for advanced codecs
- **Hardware acceleration**: NVENC, Quick Sync, VCE support
- **Additional codecs**: H.265, VP9 for better compression

## Implementation Architecture

```rust
// Flexible encoder backend system
pub enum EncoderBackend {
    OpenH264(OpenH264Encoder),    // Phase 2: Quick start
    FFmpeg(FFmpegEncoder),         // Phase 3: Full features
    Hardware(HardwareEncoder),     // Future: GPU acceleration
}
```

### Feature Flags

```toml
[features]
default = ["openh264"]
full-codecs = ["ffmpeg"]
hardware-accel = ["ffmpeg", "nvenc", "qsv"]
```

### Benefits
1. **Fast time-to-market**: OpenH264 allows quick Phase 2 completion
2. **Minimal binary size**: ~2MB for basic H.264 support
3. **Future flexibility**: Can add FFmpeg without breaking changes
4. **Enterprise options**: Full codec support available when needed

## Performance Targets

### Phase 2 (OpenH264)
- Encoding latency: <10ms per frame
- CPU usage: <30% single core at 1080p30
- Compression ratio: 100:1 for typical desktop content
- Quality: Visually lossless for remote control

### Phase 3 (FFmpeg + Hardware)
- Encoding latency: <5ms per frame
- CPU usage: <10% with hardware acceleration
- Support for 4K resolution
- Advanced features: HDR, 10-bit color

## Integration Plan

1. **Immediate (Phase 2)**:
   - Implement OpenH264 encoder wrapper
   - Create performance benchmarks
   - Validate against ControlR baseline

2. **Next Quarter (Phase 3)**:
   - Add FFmpeg as optional dependency
   - Implement hardware acceleration detection
   - Support H.265 for bandwidth-constrained scenarios

3. **Future Considerations**:
   - AV1 codec for next-generation compression
   - Machine learning-based enhancement
   - Adaptive bitrate based on network conditions

## Conclusion

The hybrid approach balances immediate needs with future flexibility. Starting with OpenH264 allows RemoteC to achieve Phase 2 goals quickly while maintaining a path to advanced features without architectural changes.
