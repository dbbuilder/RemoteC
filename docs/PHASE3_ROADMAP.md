- [ ] Automated testing

## Technical Implementation

### OpenH264 Integration (Priority 1)
```rust
// Integrate OpenH264 for production video encoding
pub struct OpenH264Encoder {
    encoder: *mut ISVCEncoder,
    config: SEncParamExt,
}
```

### Hardware Acceleration (Priority 2)
```rust
// NVENC for NVIDIA GPUs
pub struct NvencEncoder {
    session: NV_ENC_SESSION_HANDLE,
    config: NV_ENC_CONFIG,
}
```

### Advanced RBAC (Priority 3)
```csharp
public class AdvancedPermissionService
{
    Task<bool> CheckPermission(string userId, string resource, string action);
    Task<IEnumerable<Permission>> GetEffectivePermissions(string userId);
}
```

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Production Video Encoding (2 weeks)
- Integrate OpenH264
- Implement quality adaptation
- Add hardware acceleration detection

### Milestone 2: Enhanced Security (3 weeks)
- Implement E2EE
- Add session recording
- Create audit system

### Milestone 3: Enterprise Features (4 weeks)
- Multi-tenant support
- Advanced RBAC
- Policy management

### Milestone 4: Production Ready (2 weeks)
- Performance optimization
- Deployment automation
- Documentation

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: <25ms latency, 60 FPS capability
- **Security**: SOC 2 Type II compliant
- **Scalability**: Support 10,000+ concurrent sessions
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime SLA
- **Adoption**: 100+ enterprise customers

## Next Steps

1. Begin OpenH264 integration
2. Design E2EE architecture
3. Plan multi-tenant data model
4. Create production deployment strategy
